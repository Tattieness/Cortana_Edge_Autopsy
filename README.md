# Cortana_Edge_Autopsy

This plug-in was written as part of my Master's Dissertation.  An Overview of its functionality is:

The basis of the module is that it extracts the browsing history for I.E 11/Edge and also a set of artifacts that relate to the use of Cortana. These  include the speech files, html files and other files generated when talking to Cortana. The module also extracts reminders and attachments. This will include notifications such a missed calls and texts from a mobile phone, running Cortana which is associated with Microsoft Account in use.

Hope this is of use to someone

Thanks
